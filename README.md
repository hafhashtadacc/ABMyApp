# AB My App
[ABMyApp](https://abmyapp.ir) is an A/B Testing tool based on [Wasabi](https://github.com/intuit/wasabi). It works similar to Firebase Configuration with the difference it is open for all the world!

## Usage

Add maven to your project gradle file:
```Groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hafhashtadacc/mavenrepo/master/releases/aar/" }
}
``` 

Add the dependency to your module gradle file:
```Groovy
dependencies {
	implementation 'ir.abmyapp:abmyapp:2.0.0'
}
```
